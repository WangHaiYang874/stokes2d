This subroutine computes the $N$-body biharmonic interactions 
in two dimensions where the interaction kernel is related to the
biharmonic greens function $r^2 log (r)$ and its derivatives

$$
    u(x) = \sum_{j=1}^{N}2 c_{j}  \log(|x-x_{j}|) + 
    \overline{c_{j}} (x-x_{j})/(\overline{x-x_{j}}) + d_{j,1}/(x-x_{j}) + d_{j,2}/(\overline{x-x_{j}}) - 
    \overline{d_{j,1}} (x-x_{j})/(\overline{x-x_{j}})^2
$$



where $c_{j}$ are the charge densities, $d_{j,1}$, $d_{j,2}$ are the dipole strengths,
and $x_{j}$ are the source locations.

When $x=x_{m}$, the term corresponding to $x_{m}$ is dropped from the
sum
