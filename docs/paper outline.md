1. intro to problem
    1. problem description
    2. why does it matter
    3. what is already done
        1. hemholtz, the normal mode idea. 
        2. stokes, similar complex networks
    4. what I have done
    5. the paper is organized as....
2. math preliminaries
    1. stokes equation
    2. complex analysis formulation
    3. and some other simple useful equations that is not hard to derived and might be useful elsewhere
    4. perhaps also some potential theory?
3. analytic bounds for return to poiseuille
    1. making the analytic estimate
    2. plotting the estimate against some true errors. 
4. numerical algorithm
    1. how did I discretisized the geometry?
    2. how did I solved the equation
    3. how to combine local solutions,
5. Numerical results
    1. plot the analytic error bound in assuming return to poiseuille
    2. plot the numerical errors for such assumptions. 
    3. plotting the error of combining local to global. 
    4. solve for a rather complicated network of pipes to show the power of this method
6. conclusions
    1. summarize what I've done
    2. outlook. what other work might be followed?
